# simulation-of-airline-booking-system
/* This is my small final project for the C++ course at college that simulated an airline booking system. The source code is a pretty long script, I should've divided it into smaller files. However, there is a line count requirement from my teacher, so I put it in one file.
This airline booking system has various modules where users can book tickets to many places. I used some C++ tools like class, inheritance, file manipulation, etc to complete this project.
The procedure that the system requires users to go through in order to complete a reservation is registration, choosing to book a domestic or international flight, choosing the destination, choosing a flight, printing the ticket, and booking another ticket or direct exit. During the booking process, there are options to go back in between for users to have a sudden change in their registered or booked information. There is also an error control function in the system that prevents users from wrong input.
This is a pretty simple and easy-to-understand project. I hope it can be used as a reference for those who want to build a simple C++ project. This res contains this short introduction, source code, and a system output file. */
